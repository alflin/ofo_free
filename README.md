OFO in China previously had bike locks that used static code bike locks (manual fixed locks). 
I was learning shiny at the time so I wanted to create an MVP for a crowd-sourced password aggregator.

This is a very simple scaffold where I didn't even use a database to store the data. (Only used a csv file to read and write).
